This is a project I did in college to learn about Binary Search Trees (BSTs), TreeMaps, writing recursive tree-traversal methods, and the x = change(x) pattern.

The goal of the project is to morph BST code into a TreeMap and use it to store data on 9000+ books.

The main method shows how to access the first 20 books in ascending order of keys (ISBN) and prints additional information (titles and authors) to the console.
